### ssh commands to setup Ubuntu 16.04 + Nginx + Passenger

[HTML view](https://macfire.github.io/devops16/)

These step-by-step instructions are taken from various tutorials on [digitalocean.com](https://digitalocean.com), [phusionpassenger.com](https://www.phusionpassenger.com), and other sites. Some sources have been linked.  Most step descriptions have been shortened and simplified. Some step sequences are from one source while other may come from various sources.

These instructions and commands are placed on GitHub so I can conveniently find them. I am a novice with Ubuntu, Nginx, Passenger, command line, etc., so I probably can't answer any questions. However, I'll be glad to incorporate any corrections that are needed.

_Use instructions and commands at your own risk._
