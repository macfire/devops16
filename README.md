sh commands to setup Ubuntu 16.04 + Nginx + Passenger

These step-by-step instructions are taken from various tutorials on digitalocean.com, ghusionpassenger.com, and other sites.
Some sources have been linked. Step descriptions have been shortened and simplified.

These instuctions and commands are placed here on GitHub so I can conveniently find them. I am a novice with Ubuntu, command line, etc., so I probably can't answer any questions. However, I'll be glad to incorporate any changes that are needed.

Use instructions and commands at your own risk.
