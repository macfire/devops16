<h3 id="shcommandstosetupubuntu16.04nginxpassenger">sh commands to setup Ubuntu 16.04 + Nginx + Passenger</h3>

<p>These step-by-step instructions are taken from various tutorials on <a href="https://digitalocean.com">digitalocean.com</a>, <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com">phusionpassenger.com</a>, and other sites. Some sources have been linked. Most step descriptions have been shortened and simplified. Some step sequences are from one source while other may come from various sources.</p>

<p>These instructions and commands are placed on GitHub so I can conveniently find them. I am a novice with Ubuntu, Nginx, Passenger, command line, etc., so I probably can&#8217;t answer any questions. However, I&#8217;ll be glad to incorporate any corrections that are needed.</p>
